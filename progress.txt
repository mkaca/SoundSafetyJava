Created Kotlin workspace, didn't like Kotlin
Created Java workspace
Made app logic
  Audio manager handles everything sound-related for us
Tried to apply via Runnable method --> lack of thread control
Tried to apply via Executor --> Runnable method --> huge pain in the ass
Tried to apply via standard threading --> wouldn't stop via Thread.interrupt()
  Finally worked in a controllable manner using Threading and custom flags
Alterantive way (which should work) is to use Handlers --> Use this if we want to modify UI in our audioManager thread (which we shouldn't have to do)

TODO: Run app in background in a controllable way without taking up too much phone processing
